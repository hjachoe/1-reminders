# Project Description
Sometimes, your planner, favorite productivity app, and/or memory aren't enough to remember an important meeting or deadline; this can be especially true for those who have ADHD. For everyone who needs a little more help than conventional methods to remember important events, meet Knocker-up.

Knocker-up is a project written in *** designed to help users, particularly those with ADHD, to never miss an important date or deadline. Recognizing how ADHD makes every additional step - from putting an event into a planner to seeing any reminder/notification - significantly more challenging, Knocker-up is designed to minimize necessary user input and to use a notification method tailored to each user's needs that cannot be missed.

This web app utilizes an API (i.e. Google Calendar) to fetch all important events then notifies the user before the start time. By default, the user will be notified 1 hour before start time and via phone call. However, method of notification, number of attempted calls, and time of call can all be customized by the user. An example of another method of notification is to link Knocker-up with smart home devices so that notifications are announced repeateedly throughout the home until acknowledged by user.
